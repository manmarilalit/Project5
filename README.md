# Project 5 Team Repository

## Communication Plan
Our team will use the following platforms to coordinate and communicate:
- **iMessage**
- **Microsoft Teams**
- **Zoom**

## Time Arrangement
**Plan A**: Team meetings will be held on **Thursday from 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM**.

## Team Pledge Document
Each team member agrees to:
- **Complete all assigned tasks 2 days before the official project deadline** to allow time for review and collaboration.
- Follow the workflow process (detailed below) to ensure smooth collaboration and avoid conflicts.
- Actively participate in discussions, attend meetings on time, and contribute fully to the project.

## Workflow
Our team will follow these steps to work collaboratively and minimize conflicts:

1. **Fetch Regularly**:
   - Always **fetch** the repository **before starting** any work to ensure you have the latest updates.
   - **Fetch again** immediately after any team member notifies that they have finished working on a file.
   - After fetching, post a message in iMessage or Microsoft Teams saying: `fetched ...'s file`.

2. **File Access Protocol**:
   - **Notify** the team in iMessage or Microsoft Teams when you begin working on a file, e.g., `Starting work on [filename].`
   - **Notify** the team again after completing work on that file with a message like: `Finished work on [filename].`
   - **During this time, no other team member should work on the same file** to avoid conflicts.

3. **Commit Messages**:
   - When committing changes, **provide a detailed commit message** explaining exactly what was done, e.g., `Added main method with print statements for team sync.`
